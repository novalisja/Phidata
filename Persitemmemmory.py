How does Phidata handle persistent memory and knowledge bases

Phidata provides robust solutions for maintaining both persistent memory and knowledge bases across sessions:

## Persistent Memory Implementation
Memory persistence in Phidata is achieved through database integration:
- Uses databases like PostgreSQL to store chat history and session information[1]
- Enables users to resume conversations where they left off across different sessions[1]
- Supports user preferences and conversation summaries storage through AgentMemory[4]

## Knowledge Base Persistence
The knowledge base system utilizes vector databases for efficient information storage and retrieval:

**Storage Process**
- Information is broken down into manageable chunks[1]
- Content is converted into embedding vectors for optimized retrieval[1]
- Vector databases store domain-specific knowledge persistently[1]

**Implementation Features**
- Supports various vector database options for persistent storage[1]
- Enables efficient search based on meaning and context[1]
- Allows direct loading of text documents and PDFs into the knowledge base[1]

## Code Example
```python
from phi.agent import Agent, AgentMemory
from phi.memory.db.postgres import PgMemoryDb
from phi.storage.agent.postgres import PgAgentStorage

db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"

agent = Agent(
    memory=AgentMemory(
        db=PgMemoryDb(table_name="agent_memory", db_url=db_url),
        create_user_memories=True,
        create_session_summary=True
    ),
    storage=PgAgentStorage(
        table_name="personalized_agent_sessions", 
        db_url=db_url
    )
)[4]
